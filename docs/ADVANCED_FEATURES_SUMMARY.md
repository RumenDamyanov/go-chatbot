## 🎯 Integration Example

The `examples/advanced_demo.go` demonstrates all features working together:

```go
// Streaming + Embeddings + Database in one request
func (s *AdvancedChatbotServer) handleChat(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // 1. Persist user message to database
    s.conversationStore.AddMessage(ctx, userMessage)

    // 2. Enhance context with embeddings
    enhancedContext := s.enhanceContextWithEmbeddings(ctx, message)

    // 3. Stream AI response in real-time
    s.chatbot.AskStream(ctx, w, prompt)

    // 4. Save assistant response to database
    s.conversationStore.AddMessage(ctx, assistantMessage)
}
```

## 🔧 Key Technical Achievements

./run_demo.sh
```

### API Usage Examples
```bash
# Streaming chat with embeddings
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello!", "stream": true, "use_embeddings": true}'

# Conversation management
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/conversations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "My Chat"}'

# Knowledge base integration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/knowledge \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Knowledge content", "id": "doc1"}'
```
